* About
*dbc-mode* is EMACS major mode for highlighting CAN dbc file.

Originally I tried to use [[https://github.com/alexmurray/dbc-mode]], but it doesn't work on Emacs26/27.
As implementing a Emacs mode for highlighting is simple, so that I directly implement this simple
version of "dbc-mode" by myself. Next I will try to add more features to it, such as hide-show
block, flycheck by using the python package (such as, [[cantools][https://github.com/eerimoq/cantools]]), etc.

* Installation
Put the file to EMACS load path, and add following code in "~/.emacs.d/init.el"
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dbc-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Install dependency "pcre2el"
use the command *package-install* to install "pcre2el"
